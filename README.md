AuthentiChain

A Solana-powered system where each physical product has a unique on-chain certificate (NFT), and customers can scan a QR code to instantly verify if it’s genuine.
Core concept:
The brand issues a “product certificate NFT” on Solana for each item.


The QR code on the product points to that certificate.


The user scans the QR with your app and gets a clear “Genuine / Suspicious / Fake” result with details.


Think of it as a Web2-friendly, QR-first experience with Solana doing the trust + proof part in the background.
